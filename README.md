Program with a visual interface that allows for the navigation of a "file system" in a tree structure.
The tree structure, like a typical file system, consists of "files" and "folders", which contain files.

Various methods are available for searching, navigation, and interaction with the given file structure,
using recursive methods, string representations of file locations in the form of "absolute pathnames", and Iterable
objects to traverse through the file tree.
